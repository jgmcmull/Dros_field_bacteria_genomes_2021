# Dros_field_bacteria_genomes_2021
This repo contains the raw RAST .txt files generated during genome annotation, which were subsequently used for functional comparative genomics anlaysis among field isolated bacteria associated with Droosphila melanogaster.

Each .txt file contains the RAST subsystem categorization for each strain analyzed. The first column is a numerical id, which corresponds to the metadata in genome_strain_file_IDs.csv file.
